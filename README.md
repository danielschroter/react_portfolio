# Portfolio Website!

URL: daniel.schroter.eu


For this portfolio website I followed the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Cr00UYokU

The changes I made are especially focusing on the portfolio section, as I wanted to include more details about my project in scrollable pop up modals....

## To Build

if node_modules not directory not there
```
npm install 
```
Then Build Application
```
npm run build
```
Upload build folder to your hosting webspace and point your custom_url to it..

# Configure environment server
Place .htaccess in the same directory where build folder is located
