          The "Presentation" Pipeline
        </h3>

        <p>
          We have created a jupyter notebook containing a
          data-processing/training/evaulation pipeline that can be used for
          presentational purposes and also acts as an entry point to understand
          the structure and processes of the remaining notebooks. Please have a

        <p>
          We present the different model architectures in this project. Each of
          the three model architectures has an associated notebook that leads
          through the data processing and model training process. You can find
          those notebooks in the Github Repo. The most sophisticated solution
          shall be briefly presented here.

          3. Linear LSTM model for Title OR Body
        </h4>

        <p>
          This model is a variation of the Linear LSTM model for Title OR Body
          which takes in both question title and question body as inputs. These
          two inputs will be masked and passed into two separate LSTM layers (we
          use separate layers to allow them to individually discern between
          stylistic / syntactical differences in title and body). Their outputs
          are concatenated and processed as in the linear LSTM.

        <p style={{ "margin-top": "1rem" }}>
          We provide a visualization of the model architecture below. For this
          visual example, we go with the following properties:

        <h3 className="portfolio__modal-heading">The Results</h3>

        <p>
          Our metric for model evaluation is the micro f1 score, calculated over
          all samples in the validation set. In contrast to multilabel
          single-class classification problems, we cannot just pick the
          predicted target label with the highest score, since we want to
          predict multiple labels.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means that we have to set some threshold that dictates how high a
          tag's score must be for us to consider it set. Since we don't know the
          best threshold in advance, we iterate over all 100 possible thresholds
          from 0.00, 0.01, 0.02 ... 0.99, 1.00 and select the one resulting in
          the best f1 score.
