          An increasing fraction of public debates takes place online. The
          ability to automatically capture key ideas and opinions in online
          communication can be a game changer for politics and businesses.
          Argumentative texts can often be reduced to some core ideas, called
          key points. In this work we build models that assign arguments to
          their corresponding key-points and thereby asking our models: "Why is
          a certain argument assigned to a specific keypoint?".

        <p>
          We modified LIME to work with Siamese Neural Networks. Thereby we get
          an understanding why the model makes certain decisions.
          <br />
          Let's have a look at an example:

        <p>
          An increasing fraction of public debates takes place online. The
          ability to automatically capture key ideas and opinions in online
          communication can be a game changing for politics and businesses.
          Argumentative texts can often be reduced to some core ideas, called
          key points. Our work addresses the research question presented in the
          KPA shared task 2021 of matching arguments to key points. We propose
          two different models. The first model combines a transformer based
          denoising autoencoder (TSDAE) with a siamese neural network. The
          second one enriches a transformer based siamese neural network with
          additional features like part-of-speech tags. Our evaluation shows and
          performance improvement of 2% to 5% compared to the best performing
          model in prior research. On the other hand those models are
          characterised by a highly complex architecture and low
          interpretability. We implement different methods to answer why certain
          argument key point pairs receive a high similarity score. Furthermore,
          we propose a simple approach on applying LIME to siamese neural
          networks (SNNs) which is novel in literature. Hence, our twofold
          contribution to research comprises the presentation of new models for
          solving the KPA shared task and a new approach of applying LIME to
          SNNs
