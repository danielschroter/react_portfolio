          This project was done during an Internship. Hence I cannot share any

        <p>
          Within this project we built an ai-based Chatbot with Rasa to support
          front-business. The task included the development of the chatbot
          itself, as well as providing a question answering system based on
          deepset.ai haystack. Therefore we built up a pipeline for extracting
          the right answers from a set of documents managed with elasticsearch.
